Besonasige is the unity between Manga, Bande Dessine, and Western Comics within the continuity of Uploaded Fairy. It evolved out of Enovos Shikomos, or Four Frame Novels, and developed a unique character unique and seperate from manga forming its own identity after the Franco-Japonic wars between 2045-2085 A.D. The rest of my work will follow in this continuity.
