Besonasige, or the descendant of “Enovos Shikomos” created by left-wing insurrectionists, are descended from the American lineage of manga. But there are a number of differences that makes them not the same thing:

Manga is generally published in monochrome, this stems from a history of using recycled paper and publishing content in anthology magazines. Besonasige is largely published in selective color, with monochrome content being used as a storytelling device.

Manga is published in a range of panel layouts from 4koma up to 7 panels per page. Besonasige, generally relies on drama format of American comic strips, forming a darker more tragic deviation from comic strip norms.

Manga relies considerably on line art, while Besonasige generally relies of using a range of different brush types for ink and paint layers.

While similar to Japanese, Fraponic is technically a romance language with the bulk of its grammar derived from French, but do to loan words from Japanese is not mutually intelligible.

Does this mean that people who like manga will not like Besonasige? Of course not. But it should be seen as a separate entity. Nobody thinks of Manwha or Manhua the same as Manga. Yet for some reason, manga seems to be the go to word that comic creators use for work that doesn’t fit within the paradigm of Western comics.

Besonasige can be thought of as the unification between Manga, Bande Dessine ( and European comics in general ), and American comics in a way unique to itself. In the future I will be moving in the direction of superseding manga as a marketable entity.
